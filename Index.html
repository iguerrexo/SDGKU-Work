<p><MArk>MamaYumYum:</MArk> ★★★★★ | Just a tip for fuss free banana mashing... stick them in a zip-lock bag, 
    zip and squeeze! When you're done cut a corner off and you have a pour spout! I do the same for marinades
      and everything else of the sort! So much cleaner! And less dishes to boot!</p>
<p><Mark>KokoXO:</Mark> ★★✩✩✩ | The flavor of these were okay, but the texture just did not do it for me. 
    They were very,very, overly moist. On the verge of being mushy feeling, though I made sure to cook them 
    a very long time. Perhaps the poster uses smaller bananas than I did. It would help if the 
    measurement was in cups instead of amount of bananas, since banana size varies so much. 
    I won't make this recipe again.</p>
<p><mark>AndreasFamily:</mark> ★★★★★ | this was a really simple and yummy recipe! i added vanilla like 
    what many reviewers had suggested and it turned out even more delicious. it was just sweet enough for me. 
    but 1 thing to note is really to cook this on a LOW temperature so that the insides of the pancakes 
     gets cooked. it's also less mushy and easier to turn. i learnt this the hard way. the first 
     time i did this i turned the stove on HIGH and the bottom browned really fast. i was struggling 
     to turn it over but the whole thing basically fell apart cos it was still very soft and mushy inside. 
     the bottom ended up black and i had to throw it out and start from a lower temp. 
     other than that it was yummy =) thx for the recipe Andrea</p>
